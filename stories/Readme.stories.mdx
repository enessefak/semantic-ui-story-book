# Semantic UI Kit by Ole Fredrik Lie

Built for Adobe XD

## About the UI Kit

Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML. This UI Kit will enable you to build almost any design with the out-of-the-box building blocks that is available in the Semantic UI framework.

## Getting started

The purpose of this UI Kit is to be an accelerator in the process of designing any user interface for the web. If you are like me, you will typically outline some ideas with pen and paper first. Once you know what you want to design, you can easily copy and paste components from this kit to your own design.

### Assets Panel:

Use the assets panel to reuse components, change colors, or change fonts. Changes made in this panel will be reflected in the artboards.

### Fonts:

All of the fonts featured in this file are from Adobe Fonts and should sync automatically.

### Use this kit as a design system:

First save this file as a cloud document. Then from the share button, select “Invite to Edit” to share this kit with your team. They’ll be able to bring in all the assets (colors, character styles, and components) from this file to use in any of their XD documents. Plus, when you make changes to the assets in this file, your team will be notified of the changes. The team member can preview and accept the updates to keep their designs always in sync.
